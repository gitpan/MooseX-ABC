MooseX::ABC - abstract base classes for Moose

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Shape;
our $VERSION = '0.03';


  use Moose;
  use MooseX::ABC;

  requires 'draw';

  package Circle;
our $VERSION = '0.03';


  use Moose;
  extends 'Shape';

  sub draw {
      # stuff
  }

  my $shape = Shape->new; # dies
  my $circle = Circle->new; # succeeds

  package Square;
our $VERSION = '0.03';


  use Moose;
  extends 'Shape'; # dies, since draw is unimplemented

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds basic abstract base class functionality to Moose. Doing C<use
MooseX::ABC> turns the using class into an abstract class - it cannot be
instantiated. It also allows you to mark certain methods in the class as
L</required>, meaning that if a class inherits from this class without
implementing that method, it will die at compile time. Abstract subclasses are
exempt from this, however - if you extend a class with another class which uses
C<MooseX::ABC>, it will not be required to implement every required method (and
it can also add more required methods of its own). Only concrete classes
(classes which do not use C<MooseX::ABC>) are required to implement all of
their ancestors' required methods.

=head2 requires METHOD_NAMES

Takes a list of methods that classes inheriting from this one must implement.
If a class inherits from this class without implementing each method listed
here, an error will be thrown when compiling the class.

    with_meta        => [qw(requires)],

    metaclass_roles  => ['MooseX::ABC::Trait::Class'],
    base_class_roles => ['MooseX::ABC::Role::Object'],
);

        if Class::MOP::class_of($options{for_class})->isa('Moose::Meta::Role');
    my $ret = $init_meta->(@_);
    Class::MOP::class_of($options{for_class})->is_abstract(1);
